The payload in the event message received from\r\nthe DXL fabric is printed to the Node-RED `debug` tab.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* The samples configuration step has been completed (see the\r\n  [DXL Configuration Sample](https://github.com/opendxl/node-red-contrib-dxl/wiki/Client-Configuration)).\r\n* The ePO DXL service is running\r\n  (see [Running Service](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-epo-service-python/pydoc/running.html)).\r\n* The client is authorized to receive \"ePO Threat Event Automatic Response Events\"\r\n  (see [Client Authorization](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-epo-service-python/pydoc/authorization.html#client-authorization)).\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\n* To deploy the flow, press the `Deploy` button in the upper-right corner of the\r\n  screen. If Node-RED is able to properly connect to the DXL fabric, a green dot\r\n  with the word `connected` should appear under the `Receive ePO threat event`\r\n  node.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\nWhen an ePO threat event is received, the following output should appear in the\r\nNode-RED `debug` tab:\r\n\r\n```\r\nâ–¶ [ object ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick on the right arrow button to expand the contents of the object.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThe flow exercises the nodes below.\r\n\r\n#### Receive ePO threat event\r\n\r\nThis is an `epo threat event` input node which starts the flow. This node\r\ninjects a new message with a `payload` property which includes the information\r\nfrom the threat event.\r\n\r\n#### Output result\r\n\r\nThis is a `debug` output node. This node outputs the `payload` set on\r\nthe message by the `Receive ePO threat event` node."
