The payload in the event message received from\r\nthe DXL fabric is printed to the Node-RED `debug` tab.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* The samples configuration step has been completed (see\r\n  [Client Configuration](https://opendxl.github.io/node-red-contrib-dxl/jsdoc/tutorial-configuration.html)).\r\n* The client is authorized to receive \"ePO Threat Event Automatic Response Events\"\r\n  (see [Client Authorization](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-epo-service-python/pydoc/authorization.html#client-authorization)).\r\n* Under the `Automatic Responses` page on the ePO server, ensure that a\r\n  `Send Threat Event via DXL` response is set to `Enabled`.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\n* To deploy the flow, press the `Deploy` button in the upper-right corner of the\r\n  screen. If Node-RED is able to properly connect to the DXL fabric, a green dot\r\n  with the word `connected` should appear under the `Receive ePO threat event`\r\n  node.\r\n* By default, the `Topic` configured for the `Send Threat Event via DXL`\r\n  automatic response on the ePO server is set to\r\n  \"/mcafee/event/epo/threat/response\". If you have changed this to a different \r\n  value, edit the `Receive ePO threat event` node and set the value for\r\n  the `Topic` property to be the same as the `Topic` value used for the automatic\r\n  response on the ePO server.\r\n\r\n### Output\r\n\r\nWhen an ePO threat event is received, the following output should appear in the\r\nNode-RED `debug` tab:\r\n\r\n```\r\n▶ [ object ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick on the right arrow button to expand the contents of the object. The\r\ncontent may be similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n▼ object\r\n  eventMsgVersion: \"1.0\"\r\n  eventMsgType: \"McAfee Common Event\"\r\n  ▼ event: object\r\n    category: \"(This is the event category)\"\r\n    ...\r\n    ▼ source: object\r\n      ipv4: \"10.0.0.254\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThe flow exercises the nodes below.\r\n\r\n#### Receive ePO threat event\r\n\r\nThis is an `epo threat event` input node which starts the flow. This node\r\ninjects a new message with a `payload` property which includes the information\r\nfrom the threat event.\r\n\r\n#### Output result\r\n\r\nThis is a `debug` output node. This node outputs the `payload` set on\r\nthe message by the `Receive ePO threat event` node."
